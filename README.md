# RainSaver-Rainwater-Capture-System
RainSaver Harvesting specializes in rainwater collection installations also known as rainwater harvesting systems.
In Texas, a state that knows sweltering weather, droughts and the importance of conservation all too well, water supply can be an issue. And when supply is low that means water costs are high. It also means that the vegetation and wildlife suffer.
For our clients, a rainwater harvesting system is an investment that can save more than it will cost, especially when you consider the other important benefits. Collecting rainwater improves the sustainability of homes and businesses in more than one way. When rainwater harvesting happens on your property you're less reliant on the municipal water supply for things like landscape irrigation and even drinking water. There's also no concern over how water was treated and what it may contain. Plus, you're helping reduce municipal water use in general, which helps conserve a precious resource.
